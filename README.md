# Image Classification | Convolutional Neural Network

### CIFAR-10 image classification demonstrated through building a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

This is the second project in Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The program covers topics like Keras and TensorFlow, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, and GANs. In this project, I built a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The approach was to preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images were normalized and the labels were one-hot encoded. The methodology included building convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
